## Machine-Learning-Notes
In this branch, I will sharing my hand written notes of simple and advanced topics of machine learning ‚úçüèª. I have tried my best to explain the concepts in simple terms for everyone to understand. Again, feel free to look at the notes and let me know if I am missing something out ‚úå. 

`Notes are in PDF format`

**Here are the topics for the notes:**
* [Concepts of Linear Regression](https://github.com/AmandeepSinghDhalla/Machine-Learning/blob/Notes/Linear%20Regression%20Theory.pdf) with gradient descent and cost function.
* [Evaluation metrics of Regression](https://github.com/AmandeepSinghDhalla/Machine-Learning/blob/Notes/Evaluation%20Metrics%20Regression..pdf) with comparison.
* [Log Loss](https://github.com/AmandeepSinghDhalla/Machine-Learning/blob/Notes/log%20loss%20for%20classification.pdf) evaluation for classification.
* [Concepts of K-Nearest Neighbor](https://github.com/AmandeepSinghDhalla/Machine-Learning/blob/Notes/KNN%20Model.pdf).
* [Cut-off Class Probablity for Classification](https://github.com/AmandeepSinghDhalla/Machine-Learning/blob/Notes/Cutt%20Off%20For%20Classification.pdf).
* [K-Fold Cross Validation](https://github.com/AmandeepSinghDhalla/Machine-Learning/blob/Notes/Kfold%20Cross%20Validation.pdf).
