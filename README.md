In this repository, you will find all the projects which were worth practicing or which I was a part of. I will be sharing all the details and insights that I got from these projects here.
* [Notes](https://github.com/AmandeepSinghDhalla/Machine-Learning/tree/Notes) is the sub-branch of this repository where I have shared all my hand written notes about the concepts and implementation of machine learning.
* [Practice](https://github.com/AmandeepSinghDhalla/Machine-Learning/tree/Practice) sub-branch consists of the practice projects which I used to learn and improve upon my Machine Learning skills.
* [Evaluation](https://github.com/AmandeepSinghDhalla/Machine-Learning/tree/Evaluation) sub-branch consists of the notebooks of the machine learning projects on basis of which I was evaluated during my courses and various internships. The names of the internal projects have been changed to maintain the data privacy.

Please feel free to look at the notebooks and do let me know on any improvments.
